## Android App 

Code for the android app that can unlock the door, manage multiple keys and a chat messsaging feature to share keys with friends in real time.

## MicroController Firmware

Code for the arduino microcontoller and motor which controls the door deadbolt.

Note: This code may be incomplete as its coming from a private repo and I haven't been able to go through all the files that need to be edited before they can be shared. If there is enough interest (i.e. you can just ask me over email, tomiwa@atila.ca or twitter [@tomiwa1a](https://twitter.com/tomiwa1a) ), I can find time to go through and share more source code.


The code in the Android_Phlock folder can give different results based on what type of bluetooth module you are using , 
if you are having problems use this third-party app to talk to the Arduino:

For your Arduino circuit, the preferred file is the .ino file in the Arduino_Servo_Controller folder.
